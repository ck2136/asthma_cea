# Asthma CEA in R

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a framework for asthma cea modelers to utilize R as a modeling environment. The model that will be utilized is based on the ICER [report](https://icer-review.org/material/asthma-final-report/). The model was done by [Dr. Jonathan D. Campbell](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/pharmacy/Departments/ClinicalPharmacy/DOCPFaculty/A-G/Pages/CampbellJonathanDPhD.aspx).

## Project Deliverable

The outcome of this project is primarily an application (a web-application) that utilizes the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework. [Here](www.pharmacoecon.me) you can check out a preview of the application.
